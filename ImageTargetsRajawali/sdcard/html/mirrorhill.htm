<h4>Family Identification Contest</h4>

<!-- obsah -->

<p lang="en-US">The action art of Kateřina &Scaron;ed&aacute; employs hundreds of people from a certain common environment to observe not only their collateral relations but also their attitude towards their surroundings. Using a surprise and a reward, methods common to urban games and competition, she nourishes the attention of the involved public. Her activities go far beyond the methods she uses: in an artistic form they deliver a complex message &ndash; a report on the contemporary and local society.</p>
<p>Kateřina &Scaron;ed&aacute; held an overwhelming 24-hour-long lecture describing her recent projects in the summer 2012 in London. In Venice she will give a brief live sample of this lecture, named Indoctrination. Her exhibited project Mirror Hill uses the architecture of the contemporary suburbs as a matter of her social-action art. Hundreds of families were encouraged to experience their own, self-made architectural environment, its materiality, aesthetics and relations.</p>

<h4>Mirror Hill, a project by Kateřina Šedá (Brno-Líšeň, CZ)</h4>

<!-- obsah -->

<p lang="cs-CZ" align="LEFT">The suburb of T&uuml;k&ouml;rhegy (Mirror Hill), 15 km from Budapest, caught Kateřina &Scaron;ed&aacute;&rsquo;s interest as she noticed that it does not have a central common area. The only public space in which people can come together, but do not actually do so because the inhabitants of this exclusive community prefer to drive, are the streets. Kateřina &Scaron;ed&aacute; wanted the people of T&uuml;k&ouml;rhegy to reclaim the grid of streets as their space, and created the &ldquo;Great Identification Contest&rdquo; in order to connect the inhabitants. To entice many residents to participate, Kateřina &Scaron;ed&aacute; offered an attractive prize: a one-week trip to Florida. Each family was asked to draw the street as seen from their property through their open gate without another family seeing the drawing. All the drawings were reproduced in a book without any mention of the artists who created them. The participants then had a limited time to find the artist of each drawing by identifying the position from which the drawing was made, and write down the family name. This ensured that the local people not only took a good look around and walked through their streets, but also looked at each other. </p>

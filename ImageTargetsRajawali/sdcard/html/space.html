<p>The art projects involved in Asking Architecture were designed for exhibition with minor curatorial shifts to focus more directly on the architectural aspects of the pieces. Not Milan Mikula's 13m3 Space - Expansion / Atrophy. It was designed specifically for the Czech and Slovak Pavilion at La biennale long beforethe Asking Architecture was announced. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p lang="en-US">The art installation tackles the physicality of architecture. It embodies the tension of the matter and turns it into a sound. While on the conceptual level it can bear many connotations, for Asking Architecture it is the actualization of a primary feature of the spatial shell that makes it a part of the collection.</p>

<h4>SPACE – Expansion / Atrophy, a project by 13m3 (Bratislava, SK) and Milan Mikula</h4>

<!-- obsah -->

<p lang="en-GB">&nbsp;Project&nbsp;Space &ndash; expansion / atrophy&nbsp;of the Slovak multimedia artist and designer Milan Mikula was created first as a&nbsp;site-specific installation for one of the temporary spaces of 13m3 group &ndash; the 'Green house' on the grounds of the association tranzit in Bratislava (October 15 &ndash; November 4, 2007). Mikula&rsquo;s interactive physical space located in an abandoned building in a postindustrial environment on the edge of Bratislava was a&nbsp;continuation of his previous work and philosophy. Through this piece, he focused on serious philosophical themes, existential questions and on the issue of survival in various contexts. Mikula explores global values and how they shift and are found in communication, illusion and within the process of continuous change. He often utilizes abandoned buildings, factory towers, and desecrated religious objects; preferring to work with already existing spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p lang="en-GB" align="LEFT">The 2012 virtual re-installation of this project in the Czech and Slovak Pavilion tries to utilize the qualities of original installation, adapted for a pavilion that is used only occasionally and this evokes the previous abandoned building. The physical experience of a visitor&rsquo;s limited access in real space is transformed into an experience of movement in an augmented reality. Moving virtually within the strung ropes generate sounds and vibrations and support the artist&rsquo;s intention to create the &ldquo;illusion of movement, instability, temporality and metamorphosis&rdquo;.</p>

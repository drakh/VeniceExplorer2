<h4>erasing</h4>

<!-- obsah -->

<p lang="en-US">&nbsp;By removing a certain layer of information from well known images, Marek Kvetan slightly shifts the interpretation of an everyday scene. His erasing series starts with deleting a text from websites and continues with removing features from photographs. Leaving out text again, he creates cities with colorful shop signs and smiling people on posters. Through erasing the landmarks from the postcards he finally reaches his Home collection &ndash; photographs of houses with all the windows and doors replaced by a blank wall. On the top of all the social and cultural criticism, this act strips the buildings into their bare form and at the same time focuses the attention to the importance of what is missing.</p>
<p lang="en-US">The conventional architectural method of massing is brought by a simple manipulation of a real picture to another conceptual level. The fact he deals with the same topic in various media and subjects exposes the difference between the repetition of an artistic series and an architectural routine.</p>

<h4>Home (2002 – 2003), a project by Marek KVETAN (Bratislava, SK)</h4>

<!-- obsah -->

<p lang="en-GB" align="JUSTIFY">Home is a series of prints created by using the technique of computer manipulation of digital images photographed by the author. The houses or structures he chooses for digital manipulation may be seen as examples of bizarre local post-communist architecture, characteristic of stylistic confusion, sentimental baroque-like embellishment and kitsch and, on the contrary, as examples of typical standardised state housing or utility architecture of the time before 1989. Both ornament and a certain ironic social sensitivity reappear in different places of Kvetan's conceptual work. He often likes to strip his works of content in order to uncover another level of (visual) understanding of images we encounter everyday. The Home series symptomatically reveals what is left of a structure without the visual (and perhaps psychological) impact of windows, all achieved by a simple technique of erasing them electronically.</p>

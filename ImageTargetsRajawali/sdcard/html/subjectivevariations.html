<h4>a very personal architectural writing</h4>

<!-- obsah -->

<p>Anna Cs&eacute;falvay is one of the few architects - or rather an architecture student in her case &ndash; involved in Asking Architecture, though her <strong>Subjective variations</strong> belong to the Arts subgroup of the exhibition. Her original text is not only her intimate personal search of what architecture is, what it might be and what it could become to her. Using metaphors and literary processes, she tackles fundamental questions of architecture and its place in personal and cultural circumstances. Not only that &ndash; she uses architectural (or musical, using her own words) tools to build up the text itself. Repetition, cross-referencing, gradation, spatial and formal descriptions reveal a complex structure, an image with many layers.</p>
<p lang="en-US">For the purposes of the Architecture Biennale Anna converted this text into a virtual structure with many nodes and interconnections, allowing the spectator to find her/his own way through the newly created hypertext.</p>

<h4>Subjective Variations, a project by Anna CSÉFALVAY (Bratislava, SK / Vienna, A)</h4>

<!-- obsah -->

<p>The project Subjective Variations is a&nbsp;very personal attempt at writing about what architecture is. At the same time the text has an ambition to become architecture. It has a regular, almost music composition with themes and variations, and is full of references beyond itself, both personal and stereotypical. The main idea of this work is to express how the architect perceives or rather feels an abstract picture and gradually attempts to understand and grasp it by means of architectural methods until she manages to reproduce it. A more concrete picture gradually emerges from the concept through references, hierarchy, models and recurrence. In any case, architecture, more than anything else, is about limits, about the fact that the human being cannot create and own something without limitations, without trying to overstep the boundaries and subsequently fail. Regardless of how analytical and precise the given method, it continues to seek its own reasons exclusively in itself and can lead to a false illusion of power. The Subjective Variations is also a story. It tries to present the world of expressions used in a certain field. The words used have their own background and are full of academic meaning, yet for an outsider they do not necessarily have to refer exclusively to architecture and probably do not present the grandeur that we tend to ascribe to them.</p>

<p>This original text was written for the literary competition in architecture organised by the civic association Archimera, with its seat in Bratislava. Later on, the text was slightly changed to facilitate the creation of a spatial installation &ndash; a play between form and content &ndash; and enable the viewer to read and understand it in new contexts.<br />(Anna Cs&eacute;falvay, 2012)</p>

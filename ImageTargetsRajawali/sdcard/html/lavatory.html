<p>Even though H3T is the only active architectural studio in the exhibition and their mobileLavatoriesare the only actual buildings on display, the motivations, the guerilla execution, work in series and eventually the message it delivers, makes it a sound part of the Arts subgroup of the Asking Architecture. </p>

<h4>Viewing loos for everyone (Lavatory), a project by H3T architekti (Prague, CZ)</h4>

<!-- obsah -->

<p align="LEFT">Viewing loos for everyone<br />For Czechs or Slovaks this important facility is a well known thing. Such loos have long tradition in Central European region and surely belonged among favorite spots in all levels of society in the past. In some of Asian, African or South American countries the ownership of a loo is likened to the ownership of a luxury vehicle and immediately ejects the owner into higher society. These days, loos like this are considered a relic of past causing people feeling disgusted on one hand or melancholic on the other. Anyway, the visual form represents something people will always be linked to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Concept <br />The loos as such have no architectural ambitions (even though their visual style is quite comforting). The selection of places points to problematic locations people are usually not aware of. Sometimes the loos are just positioned in a way which finalizes the overall composition of the site (Petř&iacute;n, D&iacute;vč&iacute; Hrady). The true meaning lies in the interaction of the loo with its surroundings. The locations were chosen with respect to several rules. The view from all of the loos is oriented towards one place &ndash; Prague castle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p lang="en-GB">We are interested in the process of installation as well as the story of each of these objects. Their state is regularly documented, we are trying to record reactions of passers by. As our activity has never been approved by authorities we assume that most of the loos will sooner or later disappear. And it is no surprise at some locations (Vy&scaron;ehrad, N&aacute;měst&iacute; Jana Palacha).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The story <br />We have already entered the public space in 2010, intending to bring attention to real architectural or urbanistic problems by means of non-architectural objects. At the moment our research is more intensive and the results presented to public bring important feedback. We hope the future will come up with more fantastic views.</p>

<p lang="en-GB" align="LEFT">Atrakt Art's Audioturism: Bratislava converts the urban fabric and its specific occasions into the medium of music. Sophisticated simulations of virtual worlds, utopian sonic-architectonic visions, documentary retrospective trips based upon the theme of local isolation, transformation of peripheries into centres and back. Searching for a relationship between a place &ndash; city and (its) sound, on this 2004 compilation, transgresses the confines of traditional field recordings. More than a sonic document of a place, it is a multilayered city soundtrack to audio-films unfolding in the heads of experimental musicians, and thanks to the CD, also in front of the eyes of their listeners. A sonic city cut.</p>

<h4>AUDIO TOURISM: BRATISLAVA, a project by Atrakt Art  (Bratislava, SK)</h4>

<!-- obsah -->

<p>Audio tourism is traveling with sound. For some time now, conceptually thinking sound artists have been leveling the terrain differences between the sounds of the surrounding world with the help of contemporary technology, music, sound art and&nbsp;psycho-geography. Many links can exist between sound and each place with its atmosphere &ndash;&nbsp;genius loci. The point at which sounds becomes music can only be determined with great difficulty: from the unprocessed recording of the acoustic environment we work our way through sophisticated simulations of virtual worlds with elements of &ldquo;real&rdquo; reality up to utopian or dystopian musical visions that are connected with a concrete place. From field recordings through the use of fragments of existing music up to synthetically created sounds.</p>
<p lang="zxx">Bratislava is one of the capitals in the center of Europe. However it is special in something: the abrupt political and social breakthroughs in development that repeatedly interrupted and stirred up settled memory traces, population shifts and political regimes, sometimes even resulted in feelings of estrangement in one&rsquo;s own city. Moreover, Bratislava has been constantly grappling with the issue of the center and periphery; even today it is even more than ever a place of transformations. However Bratislava is also home to an interesting and lively artistic and experimental musical community. Therefore, the CD compilation Audio Tourism: Bratislava created under the supervision of curators represents two overlapping maps: one is a sound expression of the relation of the participating musicians to this city and its locations or phenomena;the second captures the topography of the local experimental musical scene of 2004. Both in a particular way contribute to creating the cultural memory of this noteworthy city.</p>

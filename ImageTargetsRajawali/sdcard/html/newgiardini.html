<h4>disappearing architecture</h4>

<!-- obsah -->

<p lang="en-US">The art projects involved in Asking Architecture were designed for exhibition with minor curatorial shifts to focus more directly on the architectural aspects of the pieces.</p>
<p>Even though J&aacute;n Tria&scaron;ka's New Giardini refers to his older installation, dealing with the low value of building industry mass products, it's the method he used to deliver the message, that makes it a part of the Asking Architecture collection. The topic of ephemeralty and decay of architecture is brought to a personal experience here - the more it is used, the less remains. What is then the final stage, when is the architecture ready? Or is it a process and do these questions even matter?</p>

<h4>New Giardini, a project by 13m3 (Bratislava, SK) and Ján Triaška</h4>

<!-- obsah -->

<p>Project New Giardini is a reference to a one day event on June 8, 2007 by Slovak artist J&aacute;n Tria&scaron;ka, New Studen&aacute; (New unconventional solutions in architecture). The event took place in 13m3 Gallery in a post-industrial environment on the periphery of Bratislava &ndash; 12 Studen&aacute; Street. This gloomy street at the intersection of a highway, lake and of a complex of hypermarkets, was the temporary space of the 13m3, where the group had organized various events for artists and contemporary culture fans (2006 &ndash; 2009).<br />J&aacute;n Tria&scaron;ka started as a painter and often combines this traditional art form with other media. His work deals with current events, contemporary society, city and landscape. He was inspired by the space of 13m3 Gallery and its floor from a large amount of gravel and created a ground plan of a fictional developer&rsquo;s project. Its monotonous nature reflected the architecture of post communist Europe both before &ndash; but paradoxically also after &ndash; the fall of the regime. Visitors gradually disrupted the installation, so at the end, what remained was only a gaudy, kitschy billboard in front of the building. <br /><br /></p>
<p lang="en-GB">The title of the 2012 virtual re-installation in the Czech and Slovak Pavilion, &ldquo;New Giardini&rdquo; is a&nbsp;paraphrase of its original title. It is still interactive, but now exists in virtual space and offers again a direct experience to the public for subverting an orderly schematic structure.</p>

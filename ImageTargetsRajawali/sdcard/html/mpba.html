<h4>a tour guide for natives  </h4>

<!-- obsah -->

<p>Urban explorations not only reveal a content of a place; they also use methods directly related to architectural creation and analysis. Pavl&iacute;na Morh&aacute;čov&aacute;'s M_P_BA is a crowd sourced map of unknown sight for natives. It exposes locations that carry an urban legend or simply were, are or could be cool. Like many contemporary artists, Pavl&iacute;na legitimizes recent past, often condemned as a representation of an illiberal aesthetics of the former regime. </p>
<p lang="en-US">The methods used are surprisingly close to architectural analysis, however it comes from the experience of a graphic designer. M_P_BA uses a blind city map with only landmarks and Points of Interest (POI) highlighted. The POIs were described by the internet community by their proximity to a well-known landmark. This means that a POI bears the landmarks in its description &ndash; recursively, the landmarks only exist when the POIs are present and vice versa.</p>

<h4>M_P_ BA 2011, a project by Pavlína Morháčová (Bratislava, SK)</h4>

<!-- obsah -->

<p lang="en-GB" align="JUSTIFY">The aim of the M_P_ BA 2011 project is to map and publicise favourite beauty spots of Bratislava inhabitants through an interactive exchange of their experiences as insiders. The artist records in the map suggestions of inhabitants for inhabitants, but also provides the information potential for the visitors to Bratislava, looking for the real image of the city, not that deformed by traditional tourist guides. Concretely, M_P_ BA 2011 maps insiders's suggestions about beauty spots, architecturally and historically important buildings, about art in the public realm, but also about good caf&eacute;s, flea markets, specialised shops, markets and bizarre places with the specific genius loci. From people&rsquo;s stories and recommendations, you can learn where you can have a ride on the paternoster lift, where you can get wonderful views and chocolate souffl&eacute;. You can find here suggestions about places for dates, weekend programmes for children or learn more about the objects you often walk past, but overlook. By sharing personal experiences and recommendations, the M_P+BA aims to arouse people&rsquo;s interest in discovering their city, to exchange information, to pay more attention to the surrounding objects and to actively participate in the activities in the city and its creation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p lang="zxx" align="JUSTIFY">The M_P_ BA is a paper map suitable for outdoor use, which annually records the present state of the city and is a sort of a report on the development of Bratislava from the perspective of its inhabitants. Apart from that, the map also has a website version regularly updated by new beauty spots, photographs and information. The whole activity is completed with guided tours of unattractive, inaccessible places with interesting history. They are always theme-based and conducted by an expert guide.</p>
